# Where are the missing exercises?

This is interesting.
As you may notice, there are some missing exercises, namely *ex[36, 37, 41, 42, 45, 47~53]*.
To be honest, I have done some of them which I don't intend to put it on github.
Some of them haven't been done yet, maybe never. 

I'm lazy, a little bit...
