Key points:
Three guidelines for the choice of inheritance and composition
1. Avoid multiple inheritance at all costs, as it's too complex to be useful
reliably. If you're stuck with it, then be prepared to know the class 
hierarchy and spend time finding where everything is coming from.
2. Use composition to package up code into modules that is used in many
different unrelated places and situations.
3. Use inheritance only when there are clearly related reusable pieces of 
code that fit under a single common concept, or if you have to because of 
something you're using.
